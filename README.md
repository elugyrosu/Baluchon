Change, Traduction, and Weather application for iPhone (project for my OpenClassrooms.com iOS developer formation)

Doesn't work without your own Api Keys (create a .plist file "ApiKeys" to put your ids in keys named "googleTranslateApiKey", "fixerApiKey", "openWeatherMapApiKey", get your ids with free subscribtions to Google Translate API, Fixer.io API and OpenWeatherMap API)
